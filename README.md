# Functional Datastructures

This repo contains a collection of performant functional datastructures, 
including Heaps, Random Access Lists, and Sets (which can be exteneded to 
maps, if desired). 

## Code:
The code for these data structures can be found under `src`, and is written 
is Haskell.

## Performance:
The app `app/Main.hs` runs some performance benchmarks against the 
datastructures whose output can be found [here](datastructures.html).
